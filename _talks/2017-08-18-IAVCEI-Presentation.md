Volcanic	eruptions	are	multi-hazard	events	that	cause	a	variety	of	impacts	to	exposed	
societies.	One	challenge	scientists	face	is	communicating	intricate	interactions	between	
various	 eruption	 hazards	 and	 societal	 elements.	 Complex	 eruption	 scenarios	 that	
include	 multiple	 likely	 eruption	 hazards	 have	 been	 found	 to	 be	 an	 effective	 tool	 for	
communicating	this	information.	These	eruption	scenarios	are	of	relevance	to	end-users	
because	they	provide	a	more	in-depth	picture	of	a	potential	future	eruption	than	those	
analyses	that	focus	on	a	single	eruption	hazard.	However,	deep	uncertainties	within	the	
analysis	 must	 be	 addressed	 to	 unravel	 the	 multifaceted	 interactions	 between	 an	
eruption	 and	 societal	 elements	 for	 the	 development	 of	 scenarios.	 Deep	 uncertainty	
manifests	 when	 probabilities	 of	 an	 event	 are	 poorly	 constrained,	 unknown,	 or	
unknowable.	How	can	volcanic	risk	analysts	provide	appropriate	decision	support	when	
fundamental	 probabilistic	 relationships	 are	 unknown	 or	 at best	 poorly	 understood?	
What	if	you	must	rely	on	limited	information	or	case	studies	to	develop	scenarios?	What	
are	 the	 implications	 if	 fundamental	 assumptions	 or	 scientific	 data	 the	 analysis	 heavily	
relies	on	 turn	out	 to	be	incorrect?	These	are	some	of	 the	challenges	volcanic	hazard	/	
impact	 /	 risk	 analysts	 must	 overcome	 to	 develop	 multi-hazard	 volcanic	 eruption	
scenarios	 and	 impact	 assessments.	 Here,	 we	 propose	 a	 transparent	 and	 structured	
framework	 for	 scenario	 development	 that	 provides	 guidance	 for	 analysts	 to	 not	 only	
develop	robust	hazard,	impact	and	risk	scenarios	in	the	face	of	deep	uncertainty,	but	to	
also	ensure	that	they	accurately	report	and	communicate	findings	to	end-users	and	the	
research	 community.	 Our	 approach	 borrows	 concepts	 from	 traditional	 gap-analysis	
methodologies	 where	 we	 identify	 and	 rank	 the	 degree	 of	 scientific	 knowledge	 the	
scenarios	 are	 based	 on.	We	 demonstrate	 how	 this	 process	 has	 been	 used	 to	 develop	
seven	new	eruption	scenarios	in	the	Auckland	Volcanic	Field.
