As urban development increases across the globe, societies are becoming more exposed to the negative effects of volcanic eruptions. Major cities exposed to volcanism, such as Auckland, New Zealand, require adequate disaster waste management processes to restore urban functionality following an eruption. Pre-event planning is critical to undertaking appropriate disaster waste management following a disaster. Modelling approaches are one the key methodological approaches to characterising and quantifying the effects of future disasters, and so are an important aspect of pre-event planning. Research investigating the interactions between the multitude of volcanic hazards and disaster waste management requirements is required to identify modelling approaches that can be used for pre-event planning purposes. 
<br/>
<br/>
This research project has involved detailed literature reviews of available published information relating to disaster waste clean-up. This information has then been used to develop modelling approaches to assess disaster waste management requirements after volcanic eruptions.
